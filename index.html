  <p><strong>Hello,</strong> this is Hyerin Kim&rsquo;s web site. I will talk about a city where I&rsquo;ve lived.</p>
  <p>The city is Song&ndash;Do, and it&rsquo;s in South Korea. Actually, Song&ndash;Do is a reclaimed ground. It&rsquo;s modern and the air is cleaner than other cities. 
	And this city gives exotic appearance. Because many Korean cities have old apartments and residences, but Song&ndash;Do isn&rsquo;t. As shown in the picture below, 
	it is the city where has the many latest skyscrapers. Even, the nature is placed around the buildings. It looks like a Central Park in NY, so most of Korean call Song&ndash;Do 
	to Korean Central Park. If you have a chance to visit Korea, I recommend you should drop in Song&ndash;Do.</p>

    <p>The first picture is night view in Song&ndash;Do. At night, the lights on buildings and the street lamps are turned, so we can see the bright and colorful night.</p>
    <p>On the other hands, the second one is the landscape in the daytime. If you want to see the whole site of Song&ndash;Do, 
    you can see the view at the top floor of the highest building. Because Song-Do doesn&rsquo;t have any mountain, so it&rsquo;s flat.</p>
    <p>If you want to see some photos what I&rsquo;ve taken, you can click the <strong>&quot;Pictures and Videos in Song-Do&quot;</strong></p>
