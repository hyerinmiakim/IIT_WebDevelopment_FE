  <p><strong>Hello,</strong> this is Hyerin Kim's web site. I will talk about a city where I've lived.</p>
  <p>The city is Song-Do, and it's in South Korea. Actually, Song-Do is a reclaimed ground. It's modern and the air is cleaner than other cities. 
	And this city gives exotic appearance. Because many Korean cities have old apartments and residences, but Song-Do isn't. As shown in the picture below, 
	it is the city where has the many latest skyscrapers. Even, the nature is placed around the buildings. It looks like a Central Park in NY, so most of Korean call Song-Do 
	to Korean Central Park. If you have a chance to visit Korea, I recommend you should drop in Song-Do.</p>

    <p>The first picture is night view in Song-Do. At night, the lights on buildings and the street lamps are turned, so we can see the bright and colorful night.</p>
    <p>On the other hands, the second one is the landscape in the daytime. If you want to see the whole site of Song-Do, 
    you can see the view at the top floor of the highest building. Because Song-Do doesn't have any mountain, so it's flat.</p>
    <p>If you want to see some photos what I've taken, you can click the <strong>"Pictures and Videos in Song-Do"!</strong></p>
